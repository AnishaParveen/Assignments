For example, when analyzing the  test scores of students in a class,calculate the average score,measure the speed of a car etc.\n",

It is used when it is impractical or impossible to collect data from an entire population. For instance, in an election, exit polls are conducted with a sample of voters to predict the overall election results for the entire country."

    "Example: Suppose we have data on the favorite colors of individuals, categorized as \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" \"Green,\" and \"Yellow.\" This data represents nominal level measurement. If we were to calculate the average favorite color (using the mean) for this dataset, it would not make sense because there is no numerical value associated with each color.\n",

    "\n",
    "ans->Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is the most common measure of central tendency and is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of data points. It represents the average value of the data and provides a balanced representation of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The mean is used to describe the typical value or the center of the data. It gives a single value that summarizes the data's central location, making it easy to compare different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. It represents the value separating the higher and lower halves of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The median is especially useful when dealing with skewed distributions or datasets with outliers. It is a robust measure of central tendency, less affected by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The mode is useful for categorical data and can be used to identify the most common category or characteristic in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a measure of the spread or dispersion of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The range gives a quick indication of how spread out the data is. However, it is sensitive to outliers and may not fully capture the distribution's variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It quantifies the spread of the data points around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Variance provides a precise measure of variability, but the value is in squared units, making it harder to interpret directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The standard deviation is commonly used to describe the variability in the dataset. It gives a value in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable than variance.\n",
