    "\n",
    "i) Artificial Intelligence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies aimed at creating intelligent agents capable of reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and making decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A chatbot that can have a natural language conversation with users, answering questions and providing assistance, is an example of AI. It uses algorithms to understand and generate human-like responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through learning from data, without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can identify patterns, make predictions, and adapt to new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Spam email detection is a common use case of machine learning. ML algorithms analyze email content and user behavior to automatically classify emails as spam or not, based on patterns learned from historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Deep Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks can automatically learn to represent data in increasingly abstract and hierarchical ways. Deep learning has been particularly successful in tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in deep learning for image classification. They can recognize objects in images by learning features like edges, textures, and shapes from a large dataset of labeled images."

    "ans->Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions without human intervention. In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs (features and corresponding target values), and it learns the mapping or relationship between the input and output. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen data.\n",
