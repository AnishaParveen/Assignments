    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans->A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information.Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. SQL databases use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In a NoSQL database, queries are focused on a collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).SQL is used for manage data that has many schemas and relations. NoSQL is a non-relational database, that does not require a fixed schema and easy to scale. "
