    "ans->Ordinal encoding is typically used when there is an inherent order or ranking among the categories in the categorical feature.Label encoding is used when there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories in the categorical feature, and you simply want to convert them to numerical labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a real estate prediction model, you might use ordinal encoding for a feature like \"Condition,\" where the categories are \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" and \"Excellent,\" as there is a clear ranking. However, for a feature like \"Neighborhood,\" you would use label encoding, as there's no inherent order among different neighborhoods."

    "ans->Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a method to convert categorical variables into ordinal labels based on their statistical relationship with the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem. It's useful when you want to capture the impact of categories on the target variable. For example, in customer churn prediction, you can use it to assign ordinal labels to contract types based on their association with churn rates, helping the model make better predictions."

    "ans->covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies how two variables change together. It's important in statistical analysis because it helps us understand the relationship between variables, whether it's positive or negative. However, it can be sensitive to variable scales and only captures linear relationships, so correlation coefficients are often preferred for more standardized and interpretable measures of association.\n"
