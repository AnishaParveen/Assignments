However, does not reads more than one line, even if n exceeds the length of the line. It will be efficient when reading a large file because instead of fetching all the data in one go, it fetches line by line. readline() returns the next line of the file which contains a newline character in the end. Also, if the end of the file is reached, it will return an empty string.\n",

This function can be used for small files, as it reads the whole file content to the memory, then split it into separate lines. We can iterate over the list and strip the newline ‘\\n’ character using strip() function.\n"
