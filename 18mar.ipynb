    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans->The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that assesses the relevance of features by analyzing their statistical properties or information gain independently of a machine learning model. It works by ranking or scoring features based on criteria like correlation, mutual information, or statistical tests. Features are then selected or filtered based on these rankings, without involving a predictive model."
