    "\n",
    "ans->Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, is preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where the categorical variable has a natural ordinal relationship among its categories. In other words, nominal encoding is suitable when the categories have a meaningful and interpretable order.\n",

    "Scenario: Consider a dataset of students' academic performance, and one of the categorical features is \"Class Ranking\" with three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Top 10%\n",
    "Middle 50%\n",
    "Bottom 40%\n",

    "\n",
    "Top 10%: 1\n",
    "Middle 50%: 2\n",
    "Bottom 40%: 3\n",
    "Nominal encoding retains the ordinal information, making it suitable for analysis or predictive modeling because the model can understand that lower encoded values indicate a better class ranking.\n",
