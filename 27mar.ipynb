    "\n",
    "ans->R-squared, often denoted as R², is a statistical measure used in linear regression models to assess the goodness of fit of the model to the data. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (the variable you're trying to predict) that is explained by the independent variables (the predictors) in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, R-squared is calculated as follows:\n",
    "R² = 1 - (SSR / SST)\n",
    "\n",
    "A high R-squared value (close to 1 or 100%) indicates that a large proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables, suggesting a good fit of the model to the data. Conversely, a low R-squared value (close to 0) implies that the model does not explain much of the variance and may not be a good fit for the data."

    "\n",
    "ans->Regularized linear models help prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the linear regression cost function. This penalty discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely, thereby reducing its tendency to overfit. There are two common types of regularization: Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization).\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, suppose you apply Lasso regularization to the model. Some of the coefficients associated with less important features, say, the color of the house, may become exactly zero. The model effectively discards these features, leading to a simpler, more interpretable model that is less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you apply Ridge regularization, all coefficients are shrunk toward zero, but none become exactly zero. This means that all features are retained, but their impact is reduced. This helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust to noisy or irrelevant features."
