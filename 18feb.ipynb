    "\n",
    "Applications: Access to APIs ensures more flexibility in information-transfer processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reach: APIs let you create layers in apps in order to distribute information to different audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: Furthermore, it can serve as a solution to create different experiences for users, letting protocols, functions, and commands be adapted according to specific demands.\n",

    "    \n",
    "REST is a set of architectural principles attuned to the needs of lightweight web services and mobile applications. Because it's a set of guidelines, it leaves the implementation of these recommendations to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A RESTful application must have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.A client-server architecture composed of clients, servers, and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client content is stored on the server between requests. Information about the session’s state is instead held with the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cacheable data to eliminate the need for some client-server interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standardized form instead of specific to an application’s needs. This is described by Roy Fielding, the originator of REST, as “the central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles.”\n",
    "\n",
    "5.A layered system constraint, where client-server interactions can be mediated by hierarchical layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Code on demand, allowing servers to extend the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (though also reducing visibility, making this an optional guideline).\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: simple object access protocol:\n",
    "    \n",
    "SOAP is a standard protocol that was first designed so that applications built with different languages and on different platforms could communicate. Because it is a protocol, it imposes built-in rules that increase its complexity and overhead, which can lead to longer page load times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common web service specifications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Web services security (WS-security): Standardizes how messages are secured and transferred through unique identifiers called tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.WS-ReliableMessaging: Standardizes error handling between messages transferred across unreliable IT infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Web services addressing (WS-addressing): Packages routing information as metadata within SOAP headers, instead of maintaining such information deeper within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Web services description language (WSDL): Describes what a web service does, and where that service begins and ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "As SOAP can only transfer messages as XML files, your SOAP API will be less performant, as XML is a verbose format compared to JSON. API calls made to your server will need more bandwidth and it will take more time to process the request and transfer the response back to the client."

SOAP web services offer built-in security and transaction compliance that align with many enterprise needs, but that also makes them heavier. Additionally, many public APIs, like the Google Maps API, follow the REST guidelines."
